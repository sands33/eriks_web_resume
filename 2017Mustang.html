              <p> There are 11 different models of 2017 Ford Mustangs being released in late Summer of 2016: V-6 Fastback, V-6 Convertible, EcoBoost Fastback, EcoBoost Premium Fastback, GT Fastback, GT Premium Fastback, GT Premium Convertible, Shelby GT350, Shelby GT350R, GT500, and GT500R.  

              Fuel economy ranges from 31 to only 15 mpg highway. Horsepower in these various models ranges from 300 to 500 from the factory. Prices will range from about $33K to $75K USD, with long waits expected for the special GT500 and GT500R models in particular. 

              The cult classic pony car from Detroit USA was first produced in 1963, with millions of Mustangs sold ranging from only 40 to 500 horsepower off the factory floor. There have been 6 distinctive body styles, and the 2017 GT Shelby 350R looks like a modern take on the 1965 Shelby Mustang GT500. Available fastback styling, plus a widened and lengthened wheelbase gives the 2017 Mustang GT Fastback, and GT Premium Fastback models a proper classic muscle car stance.

              The 2017 may look similar to the 1965 Mustang, but the resemblance is only skin-deep. Ford has packed either a modernized 2.3 liter turbocharged EcoBoost 4 cylinder, a 3.7 liter V-6, a 5.2 liter V-8 GT, or a supercharged 5 liter under the hood. Purists will enjoy a Getrag six speed manual gearbox, while commuters will benefit from Ford’s automatic option in all models except for the GT500 and GT500R models. 

              Added to modern machinery, the new Mustang has a bigger brain than any Apollo spacecraft with voice or 8” touchscreen control of the Sync 3 infotainment system. Worthy addable features include a Shaker 12 speaker audio system, plus blindspot and rear obstacle warning detectors.

              Technology coupled with classic chassis design allow the 2017 Ford Mustang GT Fastback Manual to make 529 pounds of torque for an output of 429 horsepower while still getting 14 / 21mpg - that’s pretty good! The EcoBoost 2017 Mustang can get as good as 31 mpg on the highway. The 2017 GT500 will be slapped with a “Gas Guzzler” tax when sold in the USA , but could produce close to 700 horsepower.

              The big question every single year is: Can the Mustang beat a (2017) Chevrolet Camaro or Dodge Challenger? Numbers can only predict a race winner, so we will have to track test these three American muscle cars side by side. The Mustang GT350 remains the popular choice, even since Chevrolet’s 2016 redesign of the Camaro IROC.
