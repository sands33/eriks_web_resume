              <p> My main professional goal is to find a rewarding job that pays well, and that benefits society. I am always up for a new challenge, so I am looking for a dynamic and nuturing work environment. I strive to only bike and telecommute to work- so to be in close proximity to my workplace is another professional goal of mine.
